About the mania-2021 branch

This branch was created when reinstalling 'mania', and includes
uncommitted work (5 files in total: 3 modified and 2 new). To inspect,
check differences against commit 06bb6e9 on the master branch.


Renaming

Since the protocol over TCP is not ICS, then name modules other than
ics_*.

Refactoring - server modules

Many server modules use explicit loops. Convert to gen_server.


Logging

Introduce log levels. Log to a single common log, or per-session logs?


Per-session depth

How can the search depth be set independently per session? Is setting
the depth a UI action?


Orderly termination of an xboard client

Assuming that xboard sends a final "quit\n" and then closes the output
stream, how should the TCP connection be handled gracefully?

Making xboard sessions independent

Currently sessions use a common key-value store with non-unique
keys. Either keep the key-value store using session-unique keys, or
redesign so that the key-value store is eliminated altogether.


Running on Cygwin/X

Can it be done?
